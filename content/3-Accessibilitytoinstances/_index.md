#### Configure S3 Access Permissions for Lambda

In this step, we will configure the **Lambda Function** and grant it access to **Amazon S3** so that Lambda can perform operations on data stored in **S3** (such as uploading, downloading, or deleting files).

Properly setting up permissions is essential to ensure that **Lambda** functions operate reliably, securely, and as intended when interacting with an S3 bucket.
