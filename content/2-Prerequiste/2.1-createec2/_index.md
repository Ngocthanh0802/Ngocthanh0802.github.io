## Getting Started

Before diving in, it's helpful to understand how to create and use core AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and API Gateway. You can refer to the following lab tutorials:

- [Introduction to Amazon S3](https://000057.awsstudygroup.com/vi/)
- [Working with AWS Lambda](https://000022.awsstudygroup.com/vi/)
- [Working with API Gateway](https://000079.awsstudygroup.com/vi/)

In the following content, we’ll practice implementing an image upload feature to Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda and API Gateway — a practical example for serverless data storage systems.
