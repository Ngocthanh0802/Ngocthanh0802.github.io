### ðŸ”¹ What is API Gateway?

**Amazon API Gateway** is a service that helps you create, manage, and secure APIs that connect clients (frontend) with backends like Lambda, EC2, or other AWS services.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

- Acts as a **gateway** between users and backend systems.
- **Handles HTTP/RESTful requests** efficiently.
- Supports features such as:
  - **Authentication**
  - **Rate limiting**
  - **Logging**
  - **Monitoring**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Scenario

- Create an API endpoint: `POST /upload-image`
- API Gateway receives the request from the frontend (client).
- Forwards the request to a Lambda function.
- Lambda processes the image upload to S3.
- The result is returned to the client via API Gateway.
